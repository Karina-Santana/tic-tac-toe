**Step1:**
Create 2 inputs to put the players name and store them in variables.
Create 9 boxes (divs) with a class called game-section
Create a reset button 

**Step2:**
Create an EventListener for when player 1 clicks one of the boxes the box will have an X inside, then the second player will have an O inside

**Step3:**
Create an if statement with the conditions:
Are there 3 boxes with **X** inside in one row? If yes, print that player 1 won, if not, are there 3 boxes with **O** inside in one row? If yes, print that player 2 won, if not, are there empty boxes? If not, the game is tied and no one wins.

**Step4**
Do not allow a player to click 2 consecutive times
